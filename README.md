A simple Simon game, experimentation with typescript.

- Probably my best UI project so far
- Carefully engineered sound: it's the C7 chord!

### Technologies used
- Classical inheritance structure with typescript
- SCSS for styling

### What's coming next
- Progress saving (in progress)
- Leadership board
