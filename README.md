A simple Simon game, experimentation with typescript.

A live version of this is hosted at: https://hlminh2000-simon-game.herokuapp.com/

### Game Features
- Simple classic Simon game, redesigned! (PlayStation must be proud)
- Probably my best UI project so far
- Carefully engineered sound: it's the C7 chord!

### Technical Features
- Classical inheritance structure with typescript
- SCSS for styling

### Current Technical Limitations
- Components are accessing store directly, hence they are currently non-reusable
- linear-time replay doesn't support non keyframe-driven applications
